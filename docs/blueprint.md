## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Bright orange (#FFA500), evoking feelings of fun and energy. This is a slightly less saturated alternative to the user's request, in order to avoid being too overpowering.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8F8), provides a clean, neutral backdrop. A little brighter than the user's suggestion for 'off-white,' for better contrast.
- Accent color: A slightly desaturated yellow-orange (#FFB84D) that is analogous to the primary orange, offering contrast for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that ensures legibility, especially on smaller screens.
- Use simple, modern icons, predominantly in the primary orange, to represent different categories or hints.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout that prioritizes readability and ease of interaction.
- Incorporate subtle animations for user feedback, like a gentle pulse on correct answer submission or a slight shift in background color on timer updates.
